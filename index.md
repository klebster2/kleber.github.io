# Some Projects

## language modelling

I built a chargram language model with a classmate for the Accelerated Natural Language Processing course we had at the University of Edinburgh in the Fall of 2018. 

Find that project [here](https://github.com/klebster2/chargram-model).

A sped up example of generation using what we built is shown below:

## myvimrc

I use ![Vim logo](https://images.wikia.com/vim/images/8/89/Wiki-wordmark.png "") a lot.
