# Some Projects

## Character Language Modelling

I built a chargram language model with a partner for coursework in the Accelerated Natural Language Processing course we had at the University of Edinburgh in Fall 2018. 

Find that project [here](https://github.com/klebster2/chargram-model).

## myvimrc
