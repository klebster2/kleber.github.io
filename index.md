# Some Projects

## Character Language Modelling

I built a chargram language model with a partner for coursework in the Accelerated Natural Language Processing course we had at the University of Edinburgh in Fall 2018. 

Find that project [here](https://github.com/klebster2/chargram-model).

The below example shows a randomly generated sentence by a model that was trained on n-char-grams using nltk Gutenberg data:

## myvimrc
I use <img src="https://cdn.freebiesupply.com/logos/large/2x/vim-logo-png-transparent.png" alt="drawing" width="3%"/> a lot.
